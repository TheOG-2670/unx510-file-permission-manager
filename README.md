# unx510-file-permission-manager

This Bash script displays permissions and other information for the name of a directory provided to it, as well as all other directories within its absolute path from root. It enables moving up and down the list of directories in the absolute path, as well as left and right navigation to change a directory's permissions assuming the current user is the directory's owner or superuser.
